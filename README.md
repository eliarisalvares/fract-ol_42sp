# fract-ol

*This project is about creating graphically beautiful fractals* :star_struck:

## Introduction

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured". 
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern remains the same at every scale.
Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

## Goal

This project's _goal_ is to create a small fractal exploration program


## Why is fract-ol important?

Fract-ol is the first project of the graphics branch at 42cursus. You will need to handle window opening, closing and rendering, learn to create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events to zoom in and out, navigate the images and optionally change colors. Also, is a very interesting project as you will need use the mathematical notion of complex numbers to create the image as well as play with colors.
